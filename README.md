## **"Memory"**

I wrote the instructions for this game, so if anything sounds funny, it's because my English is still a work in progress too! 

In this game, pairs of numbers are placed face down in a grid. Players have a short time to memorize the positions before the numbers are flipped back over. Then, players take turns trying to recall where the pairs are located. If they find a matching pair, they get a point; if not, the next player takes their turn. It's a fun way to improve memory and concentration skills!

**Memory Pair Game – How to Play**

Welcome to this exciting and fun Memory Pair Game! It’s designed to help you improve your memory and focus. Here are the steps to play:

1. **Setup the Game**:
    - The game has pairs of numbers placed face down on a grid.
    - Each number appears twice on the grid, creating a pair.
2. **Memorization**:
    - You will get a few seconds (e.g., 3 seconds) to look at the grid and memorize where the numbers are located.
3. **Flip Back**:
    - After the short time, the numbers are flipped back over, hiding them.
4. **Take Turns**:
    - Players take turns choosing two spots on the grid to flip over.
    - If the numbers on both spots match, the player scores a point and keeps the pair flipped.
    - If they don’t match, the numbers are flipped back over, and the next player takes their turn.
5. **Winning the Game**:
    - The game continues until all pairs are found.
    - The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

**Extra Rules**:

- If all grid cells are matched, the game ends and declares the winner.
- The game can have different levels by increasing the grid size or shortening the memorization time.

This game is perfect for building memory and concentration skills while having fun with friends!
